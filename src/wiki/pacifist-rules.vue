          <ul>
            <li>
              You may not take any action that would directly deal damage to
              anything with a life bar [any attack, most skills, some shrines].
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not force something to attack you or others [Taunt,
              Confuse, Attract].
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not set traps for things to walk into [Assassin traps],
              nor use directly damaging auras [Sanctuary, Holy Fire].
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not hire anyone [Mercenaries] or summon anything [most
              summons] to do anything forbidden on your behalf, but you aren't
              responsible for the actions of fully independent NPCs [Flavie,
              Wild Barbarians].
            </li>
            <li>
              Thorns, Iron Maiden, Spirit of Barbs, "attacker takes damage", and
              "chance to cast when struck" are permitted sources of damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offensive skills used for mobility or convenience [Telekinesis,
              Charge, Leap Attack] are allowed, but accidentally targeting or
              attacking something (which Charge and Leap Attack sometimes do
              automatically) invalidates the run. Use at your own risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Directly attacking or dealing damage, even an accidental attack
              due to the "bindings glitch", invalidates the run. Set hotkeys for
              "Throw" and "Unsummon", take care not to equip throwing weapons,
              and get in the habit of re-setting your bindings every time you
              equip or unequip anything.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crowd control skills that don't deal damage are allowed [Leap,
              Bone Wall, Decoy], except if they force things to attack you or
              others [Taunt, Confuse, Attract].
